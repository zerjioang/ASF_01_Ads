## Project requirements
* Java JDK 1.8
* Apache AXIS 2
* JDO (Datanucleus)
* Apache Tomcat

## Project setup
The project is divided in two different Eclipse projects `ASF_01_Practica_1_dao` which is designed to run in a server
providing CRUD operations to database schema via SOAP and and `ASF_01_Practica_1_gui` designed to get access to endpoint
methods generated by dao project using AXIS2 service package manager.

To run properly the project is neccessary to follow these steps:

1. Create a database schema with codification utf8 named `asf_anuncios`
2. Query sql dump file under sql folder in `ASF_01_Practica_1_dao` project
3. Generate AAR service file using AXIS2 Service archiver wizard on Eclipse of compiled `ASF_01_Practica_1_dao` class folder
4. Copy .AAR generated file to AXIS2 `WEB-INF/services` folder under Apache Tomcat installed path.
5. Run Apache Tomcat
6. Open `ASF_01_Practica_1_gui` Eclipse project and run as Java application `AdminWindow.java`

## Backup and restore data
The application can perform CRUD operations in `Anuncio`, `Usuario` and `Categoria` tables of the DB, but thansk to JAXB integration is possible to make a backup of all data stored in XML files and load it again when is needed. To perform this action just click on File > Backup data, for restore data just click on File > Restore from backup in AdminWindow menu toolbar.

Please note: Te restore backup, first you must create one from the options menu.
